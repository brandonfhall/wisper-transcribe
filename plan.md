## Deferred parity gaps

### D5 — Refine/summarize CLI vs web asymmetry
CLI runs these synchronously with `--dry-run` preview. Web runs them as async JobQueue jobs with no dry-run. Both work; the asymmetry reflects the surface (terminal vs. browser), not a missing feature.

## Job cancellation — best-effort GPU stop

**Observed (2026-05-11):** clicking Stop on an in-flight transcribe job in the web UI marks the job `Failed` in the queue, but the GPU keeps running hard for the duration of the in-flight CTranslate2 batch. The Python worker exits on the next tqdm tick (cooperative cancel via `job._cancel_event` in `web/jobs.py`), but in-flight inference inside faster-whisper's internal thread pool continues until the batch finishes.

**Why the current mechanism is cooperative-only:**
- `cancel_event.is_set()` is checked inside `capturing_write()` and `ProgressCatcher.write()` — both only fire when tqdm emits output.
- Between tqdm ticks the worker thread is blocked inside CTranslate2's C++ code, which has no Python yield points and no public cancel hook.
- `pipeline.py` itself has no awareness of the job's cancel event.

**Options for true interrupt:**
1. **Run transcription in a subprocess and SIGTERM on cancel.** The `parallel_stages = true` config already does this for the transcribe+diarize concurrency path. Generalising it to single-stage mode would mean every job spawns a subprocess (small startup cost, ~1–2 s) but gives clean GPU release on cancel.
2. **Plumb the cancel event into `pipeline.process_file()`** so it's checked between segments inside the generator loop. Faster than (1) for very short batches; doesn't help mid-batch on the GPU.
3. **Document cancel as best-effort** and add a "Force-quit" button that issues the OS-level termination (Windows-aware, no JVM-style hard kill on POSIX).

Recommendation: option (1) — reuse the parallel-stages subprocess plumbing for the single-stage path too. Tracked here until a user explicitly cancels often enough to justify the work.

## Pycord / DAVE Sidecar Migration

**Issue:** [#39](https://github.com/brandonfhall/wisper-transcribe/issues/39) — DAVE (Discord Audio/Video E2EE) blocking voice bot audio receive — **OPEN**

**Background:** Discord enforced DAVE E2EE for non-stage voice calls on March 2, 2026. The Java JDA sidecar continues to work (JDA 6.x has DAVE support). The Python side of the codebase has no DAVE implementation yet.

**Blockers being watched:**
- **Pycord PR #3159** — DAVE receive for pycord. Still open as of late April 2026.
- **discord.py PR #10300** — DAVE via the `davey` (OpenMLS) dependency. Actively in progress; issue #9948 tracks it.

**Migration path** (when a Python library ships stable DAVE receive):
1. Delete `discord-bot/` (the Gradle/Java project)
2. Write ~100-line Python replacement emitting the same length-prefixed PCM wire format over the existing Unix socket
3. Update `BotManager` to launch the Python script instead of the JAR
4. Remove the Java builder stages from `Dockerfile` and the Java 25 requirement from launchers + README

Nothing else changes — `SegmentedOggWriter`, the web UI, campaigns, CLI, and all tests remain unaffected.

## Storage architecture — SQLite full migration (future consideration)

**Context (2026-05-14):** The job queue is in-memory only. When the server restarts, in-progress enrollment wizards break because `diarization_segments` and `input_path` are lost. The immediate fix is JSON sidecars written alongside the transcript (Option 2, implemented). This section records the case for a full SQLite migration if the app grows.

**Current storage model — "files are the database":**
- `speakers.json` + `.npy` embedding files
- `campaigns.json`
- `.md` transcript files + `.summary.md` sidecars
- `_diar.json` enrollment sidecars (added by Option 2)
- Job queue: in-memory only (ephemeral)

**Why full SQLite would be worth doing at some future point:**
- Transactional writes across related data (e.g., add campaign member + transcript association atomically) — currently `campaigns.json` and `speakers.json` can drift if a crash happens mid-write
- Persistent job history across restarts — past transcription runs, their logs, and enrollment data would all survive
- Relational queries if features grow (e.g., "all transcripts for a speaker", "jobs by campaign")
- Eliminates the proliferating sidecar pattern (`_diar.json`, `.summary.md`, `_excerpt_*.mp3`, `_excerpt_*.txt`) in favour of a single source of truth

**Why we're not doing it now:**
- Requires migrating existing installs (`campaigns.json`, `speakers.json` → tables) with a one-time migration script
- Embedding `.npy` files still live on disk regardless — SQLite would store the path, not the blob
- Loses "just open the file" inspectability; needs `sqlite3` CLI or a viewer
- Schema migrations become a maintenance burden as the codebase evolves (would want `peewee` or similar rather than raw `sqlite3`)
- "Jobs-only SQLite + JSON for everything else" was considered and rejected — the hybrid model is the worst of both worlds, creating two storage patterns to reason about

**Trigger conditions** — revisit when any of these are true:
- Multi-user or networked deployments are needed (SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent reads but not concurrent writes from multiple processes)
- Job history browsing across restarts becomes a user need
- A third JSON file with cross-cutting relationships appears (campaigns.json + speakers.json are already two; a third is the smell)
